# MarcusEngine

This code is based off of [java game programming tutorials](https://github.com/marcdubs/java-game-programming-tutorials), and is the result of using [package-ify](https://github.com/marcdubs/package-ify) + some refactoring to create a decent game base.

The main/master branch will probably stay as is, but separate branches may be made for adding new features such as pixel-based light mapping or other major architectural changes.
